Overview
This project is a simple Instagram clone built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Socket.io. The goal of this project is to replicate the core features of Instagram, such as user authentication, photo uploading, following users, and interacting with posts through likes and comments.

Features
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out using JWT-based authentication.
Profile Management: Users can edit their profile and update their profile picture.
Feed: A home feed where users can view posts from users they follow.
Posts: Users can upload photos, add captions, and like/comment on posts.
Following & Followers: Users can follow and unfollow other users.
Like and Comment: Users can like and comment on posts.
Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly and optimized for various screen sizes.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Redux (for state management), Axios (for HTTP requests)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT (for authentication)
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose for ORM)
File Storage: Cloudinary for handling image uploads
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Styling: CSS (Styled Components or Material-UI, depending on preference)


Installation
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB (either locally or using MongoDB Atlas)
A Cloudinary account for image upload functionality (or configure an alternative storage solution)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash :
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-clone.git
cd instagram-clone

Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
1.Navigate to the backend directory:
bash :
Copy code
cd backend
2.Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
3.Set up your environment variables. Create a .env file and add the following:
bash
Copy code
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies
1.Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
2.Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
3.Set up the environment variables for the frontend (e.g., API URL). You can create a .env file in the frontend directory with the following:
bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

Step 4: Run the Development Servers
1.Backend:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm run dev
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8000.
2.Frontend:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
This will start the frontend development server on http://localhost:8000.
Now, the app should be running on both the frontend and backend locally.

Usage
1. Authentication: On the homepage, users can log in or sign up. If they are logged in, they will be redirected to the feed page. JWT tokens are stored in local storage to manage sessions.

2. Feed: The homepage displays posts from users that the logged-in user follows. You can like, comment, and view posts.

3. Profile: Users can view and edit their profile, including updating their profile picture and bio.

4. Upload Posts: Users can upload images, provide captions, and share posts on their feed.

5. Follow Users: Users can search for other users, follow them, and view posts from the users they follow.
